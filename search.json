    "section": "",
    "text": "From 2017-2021, scoring in the NFL increased almost every year, reaching an all-time high in 2020 as teams averaged 24.79 points per game. In the last five years, the NFL has introduced new rules limiting the way a defense plays and tackles. Young quarterbacks ripe with talent, seemingly find new ways to take deep shots down the field and be successful. Now more than ever, the NFL is catered toward offensive play.\nBut the question remains, as NFL offenses throw the ball more, what’s the point of running the football in the modern NFL?\nTo answer that question, we first need to look at the top-scoring offenses in the NFL in the last five years.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nstats21 <- read_csv(\"nfl21.csv\") %>% \n  mutate(\n    season=2021,\n    teamseason = paste(Team, season)\n  )\n\nstats20 <- read_csv(\"nfl20.csv\") %>% \n  mutate(\n    season=2020,\n    teamseason = paste(Team, season)\n  )\n\nstats19 <- read_csv(\"nfl19.csv\") %>% \n  mutate(\n    season=2019,\n    teamseason = paste(Team, season)\n  )\n\nstats18 <- read_csv(\"nfl18.csv\") %>% \n  mutate(\n    season=2018,\n    teamseason = paste(Team, season)\n  )\n\nstats17 <- read_csv(\"nfl17.csv\") %>% \n  mutate(\n    season=2017,\n    teamseason = paste(Team, season)\n  )\n\nlogs <- bind_rows(stats21, stats20, stats19, stats18, stats17)\ntopscore <- logs %>% filter (PF > 490)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=logs, \n    aes(x=RushYds, y=PassYds, size=PF), \n    color=\"grey\", \n    alpha=.3) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=topscore, \n    aes(x=RushYds, y=PassYds, size=PF), \n    color=\"red\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n      data=topscore, \n    aes(x=RushYds, y=PassYds, label=teamseason), size=3\n  ) + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = 1850.869, color=\"blue\", alpha=.5) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 3775.425, color=\"blue\", alpha=.5) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=1250, y=3600), label=\"NFL Averages\", color=\"blue\", size=3, alpha=.5) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) +\n  labs(\n    title= \"The best offenses are chucking the pigskin\",\n    subtitle= \"The most efficient offenses are throwing the ball for more than double the amount of yards\\n than they are rushing for.\", \n    caption = \"Source: Sports Reference | By Zach Cutler\",\n    x = \"Rush Yards\",\n    y= \"Pass Yards\",\n    size=\"Points Scored\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the top 10 scoring offenses in the last five years, eight of them had more pass yards than the NFL average. In fact of those eight teams, all of them threw for more than double the number of yards than what they rushed for. In other words, teams that throw the ball more have more successful offenses and are scoring more points. Outside of a couple of outliers in the Tennessee Titans and Baltimore Ravens, the same can’t be said for teams that predicate their offense on the run.\nLong gone are the olden days of the full house formation and the Lombardi Sweep. Sorry, Grandpa. In the last four years, teams used an 11 personnel (one running back, one tight end and three receivers) spread offensive formation 61 percent of the time. Despite the personnel changes and evolution of the passing game, teams are still running the ball. The reason for this is play-action.\nIf you watch any NFL team play, chances are you are going to see a lot of play-action. Regardless if a team has a workhorse back or not, most offenses are consistently faking handoffs. Many people argue that the more a team runs the ball, the more their play-action game will open up, leading to increased pass yards per attempt and overall passing game. However, this football myth is not true.\n\n\nCode\ntable <- logs %>% group_by(season) %>% arrange(desc(RushAtt)) %>%\n  mutate(\n    rushrank = row_number()\n  ) %>% \n  arrange(desc(PassYA)) %>%\n  mutate(\n    passrank = row_number()\n  ) %>%\n  ungroup() %>% \n  top_n(10, wt=PF) %>%\n  select(season, Team, PF, rushrank, RushAtt, passrank, PassYA) %>%\n  arrange(desc(PF))\ntable %>% \n  gt() %>%\ncols_label(\n    season = \"Season\",\n    PF= \"Points Scored\",\n    RushAtt= \"Rush Attempts\",\n    PassYA= \"Pass Yards Per Attempt\",\n    rushrank= \"Rush Rank\",\n    passrank= \"Pass Rank\"\n  )  %>%\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Running to ball doesn't improve the play action game\",\n    subtitle = \"The Super Bowl-winning 2020 Buccaneers had over 200 less rush attemtps than the 2019 Ravens, yet still had a higher passing yards per attempt.\"\n  ) %>% \n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Zach Cutler  |  **Source:** [Sports Reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/)\")\n  ) %>% \n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) %>% \n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) %>%\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) %>%\n    tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#E31837\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"#FFB81C\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = PF == \"565\")\n  ) %>%\n      tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#241773\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = PF == \"531\")\n  ) %>%\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#D50A0A\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"#B1BABF\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = PF == \"492\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Running to ball doesn't improve the play action game\n    \n    \n      The Super Bowl-winning 2020 Buccaneers had over 200 less rush attemtps than the 2019 Ravens, yet still had a higher passing yards per attempt.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Season\n      Team\n      Points Scored\n      Rush Rank\n      Rush Attempts\n      Pass Rank\n      Pass Yards Per Attempt\n    \n  \n  \n    2018\nKansas City Chiefs\n565\n23\n387\n1\n8.1\n    2019\nBaltimore Ravens\n531\n1\n596\n10\n6.9\n    2021\nDallas Cowboys\n530\n12\n473\n4\n7.1\n    2018\nLos Angeles Rams\n527\n8\n459\n4\n7.5\n    2021\nTampa Bay Buccaneers\n511\n31\n385\n7\n6.9\n    2020\nGreen Bay Packers\n509\n12\n443\n2\n7.5\n    2018\nNew Orleans Saints\n504\n5\n471\n3\n7.5\n    2020\nBuffalo Bills\n501\n17\n411\n3\n7.4\n    2020\nTampa Bay Buccaneers\n492\n29\n369\n9\n7.1\n    2020\nTennessee Titans\n491\n2\n521\n6\n7.2\n  \n  \n    \n      By: Zach Cutler  |  Source: Sports Reference\n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nThere is no correlation between rushing attempts to passing yards per attempt.

When offenses run the ball, they are more balanced, which takes the load off of the quarterback’s shoulders. This stresses the defense’s discipline as they are forced to play more with physicality by stuffing run lanes, eating blocks and making tackles.\nAt the end of the day, the NFL is a passing league. Teams that score the most are throwing the ball across the yard because they have stellar quarterbacks that can flip the field in a single throw. However, teams that establish a run game introduce the physical element to football, keeping the offense balanced and defense on their toes, resulting in a higher chance of scoring every drive."

Led by Aaron Rodgers, the Packers offense featured a plethora of weapons including Greg Jennings, Randall Cobb, Jordy Nelson, James Jones, Donald Driver and Jermichael Finley among others.\nDespite going 15-1 and Rodgers winning the MVP, this team often is often overlooked, largely in part because the Packers lost in the divisional round and 2011 was over a decade ago. With the rise of social media and offensive stars like Patrick Mahomes regularly making highlight-worthy plays and leading their team to score 30-plus points, the 2011 Packers have been forgotten.\nBut just how good were the Packers relative to other high-powered offenses of the 2010s?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggalt)\n\nstats19 <- read_csv(\"nfl19.csv\") %>% \n  mutate(\n    season=2019,\n    teamseason = paste(Team, season)\n  )\n\nstats18 <- read_csv(\"nfl18.csv\") %>% \n  mutate(\n    season=2018,\n    teamseason = paste(Team, season)\n  )\n\nstats17 <- read_csv(\"nfl17.csv\") %>% \n  mutate(\n    season=2017,\n    teamseason = paste(Team, season)\n  )\n\nstats16 <- read_csv(\"nfl16.csv\") %>% \n  mutate(\n    season=2016,\n    teamseason = paste(Team, season)\n  )\n\nstats15 <- read_csv(\"nfl15.csv\") %>% \n  mutate(\n    season=2015,\n    teamseason = paste(Team, season)\n  )\n\nstats14 <- read_csv(\"nfl14.csv\") %>% \n  mutate(\n    season=2014,\n    teamseason = paste(Team, season)\n  )\n\nstats13 <- read_csv(\"nfl13.csv\") %>% \n  mutate(\n    season=2013,\n    teamseason = paste(Team, season)\n  )\n\nstats12 <- read_csv(\"nfl12.csv\") %>% \n  mutate(\n    season=2012,\n    teamseason = paste(Team, season)\n  )\n\nstats11 <- read_csv(\"nfl11.csv\") %>% \n  mutate(\n    season=2011,\n    teamseason = paste(Team, season)\n  )\n\nstats10 <- read_csv(\"nfl10.csv\") %>% \n  mutate(\n    season=2010,\n    teamseason = paste(Team, season)\n  )\n\nconv10 <- read_csv(\"conv10.csv\") %>%\n mutate(\n    season=2010,\n    teamseason = paste(Team, season)\n  )\n\nconv11 <- read_csv(\"conv11.csv\") %>%\n mutate(\n    season=2011,\n    teamseason = paste(Team, season) \n  )\n \nconv12 <- read_csv(\"conv12.csv\") %>%\n mutate(\n    season=2012,\n    teamseason = paste(Team, season)\n  )\nconv13 <- read_csv(\"conv13.csv\") %>%\n mutate(\n    season=2013,\n    teamseason = paste(Team, season)\n  )\n \nconv14 <- read_csv(\"conv14.csv\") %>%\n mutate(\n    season=2014,\n    teamseason = paste(Team, season)\n  )\n \nconv15 <- read_csv(\"conv15.csv\") %>%\n mutate(\n    season=2015,\n    teamseason = paste(Team, season)\n  )\n\nconv16 <- read_csv(\"conv16.csv\") %>%\n mutate(\n    season=2016,\n    teamseason = paste(Team, season)\n  )\n\nconv17 <- read_csv(\"conv17.csv\") %>%\n mutate(\n    season=2017,\n    teamseason = paste(Team, season)\n  )\n\nconv18 <- read_csv(\"conv18.csv\") %>%\n mutate(\n    season=2018,\n    teamseason = paste(Team, season)\n  )\n\nconv19 <- read_csv(\"conv19.csv\") %>%\n mutate(\n    season=2019,\n    teamseason = paste(Team, season)\n  )\n\nlogs <- bind_rows(stats19, stats18, stats17, stats16, stats15, stats14, stats13, stats12, stats11, stats10)\n\nconversions <- bind_rows(conv19, conv18, conv17, conv16, conv15, conv14, conv14, conv13, conv12, conv11, conv10)\n\ncombined <- logs %>% left_join(conversions)\n\ncombined <- combined %>% mutate(RZPct = gsub(\"%\",\"\", RZPct)) %>% mutate(RZPct = as.numeric(RZPct))\n\ncombined <- combined %>% mutate(ThirdPer = gsub(\"%\",\"\", ThirdPer)) %>% mutate(ThirdPer = as.numeric(ThirdPer))\n\ntopscore <- combined %>% filter (PF > 505)\n\npackers <- combined %>% filter (teamseason == \"Green Bay Packers 2011\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(\n    data=topscore,aes(x=reorder(teamseason, PF), weight=PF), fill=\"grey\") + \n  coord_flip() + \n    geom_bar(\n    data=packers,aes(x=reorder(teamseason, PF), weight=PF), fill=\"dark green\") + \n  coord_flip() +\n    theme_minimal() + \n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) +\n  labs(\n    title= \"Points galore\",\n    subtitle= \"The 2011 Packers had the third best scoring offense of the 2010s.\", \n    caption = \"Source: Sports Reference | By Zach Cutler\",\n    x = \"Team\",\n    y= \"Points Scored\",\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Packers had no problem scoring in 2011.

The Packers 6.375 touchdown to interception ratio was second only to the Tom Brady-led 2010 Patriots (7.4).\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=topscore, \n    aes(y=reorder(teamseason, -Int), x=PassTD, xend=Int),\n    size = 1,\n    color = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\") + \n   theme_minimal() +\n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) +\n  labs(\n    title= \"The Packers passing offense was deadly\",\n    subtitle= \"The 2011 Packers threw 14 more touchdowns and only three more picks than the 2010 Patriots.\", \n    caption = \"Source: Sports Reference | By Zach Cutler\",\n    x = \"Touchdown to interception ratio\",\n    y= \"Team\"\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\nEven though the 2010 Patriots had a better touchdown to interception ratio than the Packers, Green Bay had a larger sample size and blew them out of the water in terms of touchdowns thrown. The Packers threw 14 more touchdowns and only three more interceptions during the Patriots.\nWere the 2011 Packers the best offense of the 2010s? No, probably not. That award would likely go to the 2018 Chiefs or the 2013 Broncos. However, the Packers had a deadly efficient passing offense that repeatedly moved the chains and finished drives while rarely turning the ball over."
