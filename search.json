    "text": "From 2017-2021, scoring in the NFL increased almost every year, reaching an all-time high in 2020 as teams averaged 24.79 points per game. In the last five years, the NFL has introduced new rules limiting the way a defense plays and tackles. Young quarterbacks ripe with talent, seemingly find new ways to take deep shots down the field and be successful. Now more than ever, the NFL is catered toward offensive play.\nBut the question remains, as NFL offenses throw the ball more, what’s the point of running the football in the modern NFL?\nTo first answer that question, we need to let’s look at the top-scoring offenses in the NFL in the last five years.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nstats21 <-
